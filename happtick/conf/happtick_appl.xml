	    <!-- chain
	         With chains it is possible to define process chains depending to events or other chains.
	         The scheduler tries to start the applications in the order like they are configured within a chain.
	         He uses the configuration details for applications:
	         - applicationId
	         - client ip
	         - executable
	         - dependencies
	         Other informations are ignored (options, timeplan, dependencies, etc.).
	    
	         If loop is true the chain will start again. For a chain which must be started depending to another chain it make
	         no sense setting loop to true.
	         Application start can depend to one event or prevented by one event.
	         When the skip flag is set to false the chain waits for the end of the application.
	         If skip = true and the preventEvent for a application is fired the chain overleaps this application and starts the next one.
